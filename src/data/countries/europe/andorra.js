  description: 'Andorra is a small landlocked microstate in the Pyrenees mountains between France and Spain. Known for its duty-free shopping, ski resorts, and unique political system with two co-princes (the President of France and the Bishop of Urgell). The country has no military and has never been in a war. Andorra is famous for its mountainous terrain, medieval architecture, and as a popular destination for winter sports and tourism.'
