  description: 'Dominica, known as the "Nature Island of the Caribbean," is renowned for its pristine rainforests, waterfalls, and hot springs. The island is home to the world\'s second-largest hot spring lake and is one of the few places where sperm whales can be seen year-round. Unlike many Caribbean islands, Dominica has black sand beaches due to its volcanic origin. The country is committed to becoming the world\'s first climate-resilient nation.'
